# Zero-Trust Credential Proxy & Secret Masking Guide

Sheepdog includes a built-in Credential Proxy that allows AI agents to make outbound API requests without ever exposing raw API keys or secrets to agent code or LLM context windows.

---

## 1. Overview

Agent applications often need to issue HTTP calls to LLM providers (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face) or external microservices. Storing raw API keys in environment variables inside an untrusted agent environment risks prompt injection leaks or secret theft.

The Sheepdog Credential Proxy operates as a local HTTP proxy server that intercepts requests matching predefined route patterns and injects authentication headers in memory before forwarding requests upstream.

---

## 2. Configuring Proxy Routes (`RouteConfig`)

```python
from sheepdog.sandbox.proxy import CredentialProxy, RouteConfig

proxy = CredentialProxy(routes=[
    RouteConfig(
        prefix="/openai",
        upstream="https://api.openai.com",
        credential_source="env:OPENAI_API_KEY",
        header_name="Authorization",
        header_prefix="Bearer "
    ),
    RouteConfig(
        prefix="/anthropic",
        upstream="https://api.anthropic.com",
        credential_source="env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
        header_name="x-api-key"
    )
])
```

---

## 3. Proxy Lifecycle & Environment Injection

```python
# Start the local HTTP proxy server
proxy.start()

# Automatically sets HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY in the environment
proxy.set_env()

# Agent code executes requests through the proxy
# e.g., requests to http://localhost:<port>/openai/v1/chat/completions
# are rewritten to https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions with API key attached.

# Clean up environment variables and shutdown proxy
proxy.restore_env()
proxy.stop()
```

## 4. Origin-Form vs Absolute-Form Request Handling

The Credential Proxy handles both HTTP request forms transparently:

- **Origin-Form**: `GET /openai/v1/models`
- **Absolute-Form**: `GET http://api.openai.com/openai/v1/models`

Query string parameters are preserved during path rewriting, and unmatched requests pass through untouched according to the compartment's network access policy.
